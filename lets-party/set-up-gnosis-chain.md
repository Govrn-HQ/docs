# â›“ Set up Gnosis Chain

1. **Add Gnosis Chain to Wallet**

To check on Metamask, hover over the Network to switch to Gnosis Chain.&#x20;

If you can't find it, you can easily set it up. Just follow this [tutorial](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-gnosis-chain-formerly-xdai-e0deb1541757) on how to set it up with Metamask.&#x20;

**2. Purchase DAI from Centralized Exhange**\
Next, youâ€™ll need some xDAI to cover transaction fees on Gnosis Chain. You cannot buy xDAI directly as it is a bridge from DAI on the Ethereum mainnet. Because of this, you will have to purchase DAI using a trading platform and then bridge it to xDAI. You can use Coinbase, FTX, Binance or your preferred exchange to purchase DAI on Ethereum mainnet.

**3. Bridge DAI from Ethereum Mainnet to xDAI on Gnosis Chain**

Once you purchase DAI, you can head over to the [xDAI Bridge](https://bridge.gnosischain.com/). Youâ€™ll need to connect your wallet and swap _DAI from Ethereum Mainnet_ to _xDAI on Gnosis Chain_.

Check out this [tutorial on how to use the xDAI bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKdh2cOOqUs)

ðŸ‘‰ Tip: Youâ€™ll need some ETH in your wallet to bridge over to Gnosis Chain.
{% endhint %}

**4. Connecting to Govrn Web App**

Once it successfully completes on both chains, youâ€™ll have xDAI in your wallet.

Youâ€™re now able to mint on-chain contributions using Govrnâ€™s Web App!! ðŸ¥³

You can connect to our Web App as long as you have added the Gnosis Chain. You just wonâ€™t be able to mint on-chain if you donâ€™t have some small amount of xDAI to cover the cost of the transaction.

### Get xDAI using Gnosis Faucet&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want to bridge from mainnet to Gnosis chain, you can receive small amounts of xDAI each day using the [Gnosis Chain faucet](https://gnosisfaucet.com/). This should be enough to mint a couple contributions at once.&#x20;
