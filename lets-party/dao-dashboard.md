Under the left panel, you'll find the `DAOs` tab. Here, you'll see all your associated DAOs. Once you click one of the DAO(s) you're associated with, you'll be taken to this beautiful DAO Dashboard.&#x20;

Here, you'll get a heatmap of the density and number of contributions reported over time. You'll track some metrics like `average weekly active members` and `contributions this month` along with more to come.&#x20;

You'll also see contributions by `member` and by `type`. As you scroll down the page, you can track the recent contributions made and view all the details.&#x20;
