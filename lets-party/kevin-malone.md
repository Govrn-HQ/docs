# ðŸ¤– Kevin Malone

To use Govrn, youâ€™ll be interacting with our Discord Bot, Kevin Malone.

Kevin Malone is our friendly DAO Accountant that helps you submit, record, and keep track of your contributions. To use Kevin, there are four main commands.

### ðŸ’¬ Commands

Run the below commands in a DM with Kevin Malone or in your DAO's discord server. <mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**/join**</mark>

The /join command is the first command you should use when you enter a discord server or join a DAO.  This is the onboarding step that both helps you join that DAO and sets you up in Govrn to start recording your contributions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**/update**</mark>

Once you run /join, youâ€™ll be asked to give different pieces of onboarding information to help set you up.  We know that sometimes we input the wrong information, so the update command allows you to update and/or fix any wrong ID information!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**/report**</mark>

The third, and most important command is the report command. Once you run this command, Kevin will send you a link to the web portal that is specific to your DAO. Once you open the web portal, you can:&#x20;

&#x20;        a. Select the user youâ€™re reporting for (yourself)&#x20;

&#x20;        b. Choose a contribution type from the predefined list (or write in your own)

&#x20;        c. Add the date of the contribution

&#x20;        d. Add a short description
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**/history**</mark>

After you have been submitting contributions, you will want to receive a report of your contributions. Luckily, Kevin can help you do that. When you start typing /points, a list of date range options will appear. Choose the date range you want to (note: this filters your contribution by the date the contribution happened, not the submission date). Kevin will send you a table of your contributions. Finally, heâ€™ll give you an option to download a csv file of the report as well!
