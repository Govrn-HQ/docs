# ðŸŒ¿ Mint Your Contributions

### 1. Navigate to the Contributions Tab

Navigate to the "Contributions" Tab on the sidebar.  This should bring up your contributions page.&#x20;

### 2. Select the Contributions you want to mint

Take a look at your staged contributions. Which ones are the ones you want to mint?  Once you find the contributions you want to mint, click the checkbox to the left of the contributions.

### 3. Click the Mint button

Once you've selected all the contributions you want to mint, go ahead and click the mint button in the upper right hand.

### 4. Confirm the Mint

Before you mint, double check that these are the contributions you want to mint!  Minting a contribution makes the contribution public.  That means others will be able to read the Contribution Name!  All contributions are currently minted to [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/evm).

Once you hit the mint button, you should receive a notification on your connected wallet to approve the transaction.  Hit the approve button and the transaction is off!

**Don't be nervous!**  If you accidentally mint a contribution you didn't mean to mint, you can delete (aka burn it) at a later time.

### 5.  Wait and Celebrate ðŸ¥‚

Once you send the transaction, we will monitor Gnosis Chain for your contribution to be minted.  Once confirmed, we will send you a success message that should pop up in the upper right of the screen!

And boom!!!  Congratulations!!! You've officially minted your first contribution.

Smile and give yourself a high five. You deserve it. :sunglasses:
