# âž• Report Your Contributions

Reporting contributions is the key action you can take!  It's incredibly simple and easy for you to do.

## Steps to record a contribution

### 1. Navigate to the Report Tab

Once you're logged into Govrn, you'll land on the "Home" Tab.  The first step is to Navigate to the "Report" Tab.

It's from this tab that you'll be able to report your contributions!

Fun Tip!  Try clicking on the floating "+" icon in the button right corner.  This brings up a quick reporting form module so you can record your action from any screen!
{% endhint %}

### 2. Fill in the fields for your Contribution

We've broken Contributions down into a couple of components:

* **Name of Contribution**:  Give your contribution a name or title.  This should be concise so others can get a quick idea of what you did.
* **Activity Type:**  Denote the category or type of activity of the contribution you're making.  This is a higher level category you can give to your contribution so you can best understand the contributions that you're making over time.  You can select from a predefined option, or create your own!
* **Details:**  Here you can add a detailed description of the contribution you made.  This is an important space because other DAO members will go in and read the details as a way to know whether they should "Attest" to this contribution!  We recommend writing 1-2 sentences explaining what it is you did.
* **Proof of Contribution:**  Add a link to the proof of the contribution you made.  Depending on the DAO and contribution, some might ask for proof while others are ok without it.
* **DAO:**  Select the DAO that you want to apply this contribution to.  Did you do the work outside of any DAO?  No problem!!  Just leave blank and add the DAO at a later time!
* **Date of Contribution Engagement (UTC):**  Select the date that your contribution took place on.  This helps you keep track of when the work was actually done and see contribution patterns over time.

### Sample Contrbutions

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example 1" %}

* **Details:** Prepared figjam & hackmd files proposing several growth tactics to implement in Q1-Q2 of 2023. Tim & I revised the proposal and created loom videos for our team to review over async. Scheduled a project planning meet to discuss and prioritize the top strategy.
* **Proof of Contribution:** \<insert link to figjam file>
* **DAO:** Govrn
* **Date of Contribution Engagement (UTC):** 02/15/2023
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example 2" %}
* **Name of Contribution:** Led a demo call with DelevDAO
* **Activity Type:** Demo Call
* **Details:** Led a demo call to the founder of DelevDAO with Stefen.&#x20;

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The granularity of details can differ based on the frequency of the task. Example 2 was a `demo call` activity type which occurs often within Govrn. Providing details wouldn't be as insightful as tasks that are non-recurring such as example 1 of creating a growth strategy. These repetitive tasks will differ based on your DAO or organization.&#x20;

Furthermore, activity types will differ between different types of DAOs. Investment DAOs have different tasks & responsibilities from Social and Education DAOs. Activity Types are also unique to DAOs as it's essentially the DAO's contributor guidelines.

{% hint style="info" %}
Writing a good details section can create learning content for the rest of your DAO. When a new DAO member wants to learn how to do something (like onboarding a new member), they can read your contribution details!

### 3.  Smash that "Add Contribution" Button

Boom!!!! And you did it!  You've now officially recorded your first contribution.
