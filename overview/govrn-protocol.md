## 🛠 How to Use Govrn

There are two main ways to interact with the Govrn protocol.

1. &#x20;Govrn web app
2. Kevin Malone discord bot

### 1. Get started

To start, we recommend creating a profile on the **Govrn web app**.  You'll be prompted to connect your wallet and create a username for your Govrn profile.&#x20;

The cool part is you can use this profile for multiple DAOs or tailor your profile based on each DAO you'd like to report contributions to.&#x20;

### 2. Report your contributions

Now you're all set up to [report your first contribution(s)! ](../archived/report.md) Click on the + in the bottom right to complete the reporting flow.  You'll be asked for a contribution name, activity type, optional details and documentation, and the date you completed the contribution.

> Tip: We've found that clear context and concise documentation leads to higher likelihood of receiving attestations and future value!

### 3. Manage your contributions

You've reported some contributions.  Great!!  Welcome to the Hot DAO Contributor Summer Club 😎

So what happens next? &#x20;

#### View your contribution history

> Govrn provides a [full history of your contributions](../product-guides/manage-your-contributions.md), both itemized and by contribution type.  This is a great way to see your contributions across all DAOs you participate in.

**Associate your contributions to a DAO**

#### **Receive and give attestations**

> Govrn supports peer to peer attestations to validate contributions.  Curious about attestations? Learn more [here](../fundamentals/attestations.md).

#### Mint your contributions&#x20;

> Contributions can be minted on chain!  Read about the minting process [here](../product-guides/mint-your-contributions.md).
