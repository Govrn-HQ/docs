# ðŸŒ» DAO Leaders

While Govrn is designed to empower DAO Contributors, it has the additional side benefit of helping DAO Leaders.  Beside the obvious of it reducing the workload on DAO Leaders by enabling DAO Contributors to Coordinate, it also empowers DAO Leaders to be better DAO Contributors themself!

The information that is generated by the Govrn Protocol will help you:

* Fundraise for your DAO more effeciently
* More easily onboard new members
* Understand your DAO's engagment and contributinos
* See the secondary value you've created via your DAO Contributors contributing to other DAOs

We've found that when you ask DAO Leaders "What are the contributions that make up their DAO?", most just stare blankly back at us.

Repeat after me, You and your DAO aren't defined by the treasury it holds. &#x20;

You are defined by the contributions your DAO makes.

We're going to make it easier for you to better understand the contributions your DAO makes. &#x20;

We're giving you the superpower to create movements, not just stagnant ccommunities.&#x20;
