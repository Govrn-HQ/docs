# ðŸŒ» DAO Leaders

While Govrn is designed to empower `DAO Contributors`, it has the additional side benefit of helping `DAO Leaders`.  &#x20;

This is because enabling DAO contributors to better coordinate reduces the workload on DAO Leaders.  And, DAO Leaders are also empowered to become better DAO Contributors themselves!

### How Contributions Help the DAO as a Whole

The information that is generated by the Govrn Protocol will help you:

* Fundraise for your DAO more efficiently
* More easily onboard new members
* Understand your DAO's engagement rates and contribution patterns
* See the secondary value you've created via your DAO Contributors contributing to other DAOs and the broader ecosystem

### DAO value derives from Contributions, not the Treasury

We've found that when you ask DAO Leaders "What are the contributions that make up their DAO?", most just stare blankly back at us.  This is because so much coordination information gets lost or unnoticed!!&#x20;

Why?  It's easy to track the flow of money, but there's no easy way to track the flow of contributions. That's why we're building `Govrn Contribution Primitives`.

**Because You and your DAO aren't defined by the treasury it holds; you're defined by the Contributions your DAO makes.**&#x20;

Our goal is to make it easy for you to better understand the contributions your DAO makes. &#x20;

We're giving you the superpower to create movements, not just stagnant communities.&#x20;
