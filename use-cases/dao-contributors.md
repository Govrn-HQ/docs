# üõ† DAO Contributors

So you're a DAO Contributor?

Well first off..... **Welcome** :wave:**!!!!**  Not only to the Govrn Movement, but to the DAO movement.  In our opinion, the DAO Movement represents a greater shift to the Age of Communities.

### Leveling up üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Now that you're part of the movement, how do you actually become an effective participant or contributor?&#x20;

Well fear not, Govrn is here to help.  Simply put, we believe the best way to empower DAOs is to empower the Contributors that make them up.

Govrn will empower you by giving you the following superpowers:

*   **Ownership of Contributions:**  For the first time, you're empowered to have immutable records, owned by yours truly, validated by your peers.  For the first time, when someone asks you "What do you do?", you can just point them to your contributions.

    * Why does this matter?  It means you are in charge of the labor you have contributed.  No more being beholden to bad managers, extractive organizations, or coworkers that forgot who you were. &#x20;
    * Now you have exit rights, meaning you have accountability over your organization.


*   **Multi-DAO Contributions:**  Rarely do your contributions only create value for one DAO or Community.  For example, when I contribute to Raid Guild, that also creates value for MetaCartel, and potentially the ecosystem as a whole.

    * When you think of contributions as things that belong to Contributors, and are applied to communities, you're able to have one contribution create value for multiple communities.  This is only possible when **YOU** own your contribution, rather than it being owned by a community or organization.


* **A DAO built by Contributions:**  Right now DAOs are defined by the treasury they hold.  By recording your contributions, and attesting to others' contributions, we can create a DAO that's defined by the contributions it makes, not the money it holds.

All of this is designed to empower **you,** the DAO Contributor.  And by empowering Contributors, we think DAOs and communities will benefit as well.

If that sounds good to you, then let us repeat, Welcome to the Govrn Movement.
