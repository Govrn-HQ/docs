# âž• Report

Reporting is the first action a contributor will take when they land on the Govrn Platform.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Reporting creates contributions. Contributions become the atomic unit that feeds the Govrn Protocol.
{% endhint %}

The different sections of the reporting form are:

* **Contribution Name:**  A title for your contribution (e.g. Onboarding call with new DAO member)
* **Activity Type:**  A type category of the contribution (e.g. Onboarding Call)
* **Details:**  Give additional details of the contribution.  Others will read this to be able to better evaluate what your contribution actually was (e.g. Had a 30 minute call with Alice to onboard her into the DAO.  We reviewed key processes and locations of documents.)
* **Proof of Contribution:**  A link to any record of the contribution (e.g. a link to a picture of the zoom session)
* **Date of Contribution:**  The date the contribution occurred (e.g. June 1, 2022)

Once you report your contribution, this will stage the contribution in the [**Contributions Page**](contributions-page.md).
