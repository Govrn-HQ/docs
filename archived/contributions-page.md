# ðŸ“Š Contributions Page

There are two tabs of the Contributions page:

1. Contributions
2. Contributions Types

### Contributions

The Contributions Tab shows you a list all the contributions you have uploaded to the system and their relevant details.  A key detail it shows is the status.

There are two statuses for a contribution:

1. Staged
2. Minted

**Staged contributions** are contributions you've uploaded but haven't minted on-chain yet.

**Minted contributions** are just that, contributions you have minted on-chain.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, contributions are minted to Gnosis Chain.

### Contribution Types

The Contribution Types tab shows you a rolled up view of all your contributions by contribution type.  For example, if you've done an `Onboarding Call` five times, you would see it as one line item, with the number `5` next to it.

* Additionally, in shows the details of the last occurence you made the contribution.

This view is great to understand **what contributions you make the most often**, and understand what you haven't done in a while.
