# ðŸ”§ Manage Your Contributions

There are two tabs of the Contributions page:

1. &#x20;`Contributions`
2. `Contributions Types`

### Contributions

The `Contributions Tab` shows you a list all the contributions you have uploaded to the system and their relevant details.  A key detail it shows is the status.

There are two statuses for a contribution: Staged and Minted.

**Staging contributions** are contributions you've uploaded but haven't minted on-chain yet.

**Minted contributions** are just that, contributions you have minted on-chain.

Think of the staging area as a soft record of your contributions.  This means that if you realize you made an error or mistake, you can click on the pen icon to **edit** the contribution or the trash can to **delete** the contribution.

Once you are satisfied with your contribution records, you are ready to mint!!  Learn how to mint contributions [here](mint-your-contributions.md).  Currently, contributions are minted on **Gnosis Chain**. &#x20;

The following happens once a contribution is minted:

* Your DAO receives notice of the contribution
* Others can start attesting to your contribution

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once a contribution is minted, you aren't able to edit it. But, we will soon be enabling a "delete" feature for minted contributions.
{% endhint %}

### Contribution Types

The `Contribution Types` tab shows you a rolled up view of all your contributions by type.  For example, if you've done an `Onboarding Call` five times, you would see it as one line item, with the number `5` next to it.

* Additionally, it shows the details of the last occurrence you made the contribution.

This view is great to understand **what contributions you make the most often**, and understand what you haven't done in a while.
