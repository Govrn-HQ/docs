# ðŸ“Š Manage Your Contributions

There are two tabs of the Contributions page:

1. &#x20;Contributions
2. Contributions Types

### Contributions

The Contributions Tab shows you a list all the contributions you have uploaded to the system and their relevant details.  A key detail it shows is the status.

There are two statuses for a contribution: Staged and Minted.

**Staging contributions** are contributions you've uploaded but haven't minted on-chain yet.

**Minted contributions** are just that, contributions you have minted on-chain.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, contributions are minted on Gnosis Chain.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, if you realized you made an error or mistake, you can click on the pen icon to **edit** the contribution or the trash can to **delete** the contribution.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once a contribution is minted, you aren't able to edit a contribution, and for now you aren't able to delete it either (we will soon be enabling a "delete" feature for minted contributions)
{% endhint %}

### Contribution Types

The Contribution Types tab shows you a rolled up view of all your contributions by contribution type.  For example, if you've done an `Onboarding Call` five times, you would see it as one line item, with the number `5` next to it.

* Additionally, it shows the details of the last occurrence you made the contribution.

This view is great to understand **what contributions you make the most often**, and understand what you haven't done in a while.
