## Steps to record a contribution

### 1. Navigate to the Report Tab

Once you're logged into Govrn, you'll be landed on the "Contributions" Tab.  The first step is to Navigate to the "Report" Tab.

It's from this tab that you'll be able to report your contributions!

Fun Tip!  Try clicking on the floating "+" icon in the button right corner!  This brings up a quick reporting form module so you can record your action from any screen!

### 2. Fill in the fields for your Contribution

We've broken Contributions down into a couple of components.

1. **Name of Contribution**:  Give your contribution a name or title!  This should be short and concise so other can get a quick idea of what you did. &#x20;
   * **Example:** Led onboarding call with new Stefen!
2. **Activity Type:**  What category or type of activity is the contribution you're making.  This is a higher level category you can give to your contribution so you can best understand the contributions you're making.  You can select from a predefined option or create your own!
   * **Example:**  Led an onboarding call
3. **Details:**  Here you can add a detailed description of the contribution you made.  This is an important space, other DAO members will go in and read the details as a way to know whether they should "Attest" to this contribution!  We recommend writing 1-2 sentences explaining what it is you did.
   * **Example:**  I had an onboarding call with Stefen via Discord.  During the call I walked him through how to use Govrn v1 and showed him how to maximize value of the platform.  It was awesome seeing how excited he got!
   * ****:bulb: **Idea** - Writing a good detail section can create learning content for the rest of your DAO.  When a new DAO member wants to learn how to do something (like onboarding a new member), they can read your contribution details!
4. **Proof of Contribution:**  Add a link to the proof of the contribution you made.  Depending on the DAO and contribution, some might ask for proof while others are ok without it.
5. **DAO:**  Select the DAO that you want to apply this contribution too.  Did you did the work outside of any DAO?  No problem!!  Just leave blank and add the DAO at a later time!
   * **Example:**  Govrn
6. **Date of Contribution Engagement (UTC):**  Select the date that your contribution took place on.  This helps you keep track when the work was actually done.
   * **Example:**  07/1/2022&#x20;

### 3.  Smash that "Add Contribution" Button

Boom!!!! And you did it!  You've now officially recorded your first contribution.
